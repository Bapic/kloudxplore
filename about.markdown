Hello everyone! In my professional world - I work as a *Cloud Solution Architect* helping customers and partners everyday to realize their digital transformation goals. I work across infrastructure & application modernization, hybrid cloud strategies and its implementation.

In my personal front - I like to explore, experiment with different cloud services, learn and build my own labs. The very thought to be able to share effectively, all from a single place brought **'KloudXplore'** to life. I started this small effort with Github-pages and looking forward to expand as I continue to add more articles, code repo and technical know-how. I hope you like it and share your honest feedback with me.

Thanks and welcome to KloudXplore, - Bapi.
