# Capabilities you need to succeed with your multi-cloud and edge strategy

![Alt text](/kloudxplore/images/multicloudimg0001.jpg)

Several organizations all over the world are adopting multi-cloud and edge strategy, to drive innovation and digital transformation. As you look closely, the below are some of the areas that they are trying to address:

1.  Avoid lock-in to a single Cloud service provider
2. Cater to growing customer demands (including choice of cloud service provider and deployment locations)
3. Increase the availability & recoverability of critical global applications across cloud service providers and locations
4. Run intelligent applications and process data close to where they are.
5. Send only the data that is required to cloud while addressing data residency and regulatory aspects
6. …and may be some more…

Strategy is one thing and making is real is another. Adopting multi-cloud and edge architecture poses newer sets of challenges. However, there appears to be an approach to solve these. The below are top three capabilities what I found to be very helpful.

1. One unified Inventory View: To ensure consistent governance, security and monitoring strategy at scale across all locations - cloud, on-premises or at the edge. Bring all insights into a single control plane for various teams to observe, analyze and act from a single source of information. You may call it an unified dashboard or workspace with appropriate role-based access control implemented for security operator, Infrastructure operator or Infrastructure Administrator.

2.  Innovate faster while Optimizing cost: Leveraging modern and intelligent services help to innovate faster. Include such solutions that can help you to bring always-updated, elastic cloud intelligence to any location. A key construct that can help you extend the same cloud technology services to the infrastructure of your choice. Secondly, you may have existing investments on-premises or other clouds and you want to leverage these to optimize costs and not just move from one service provider to another. Hence, a solution that can make both of them happen is a key to your success.

3.  Consistent operating model:  Managing workloads across multiple cloud and on-premises with a consistent experience and operating model is very important. As you digitally transform - your organization requires insights, your employees require processes and tools that empower them. Make it seamless and similar all across. For example an administrator should be able to perform a day job - such as update management, change tracking, policy, automation, governance etc. following the same process with the same sets of tools across various environments irrespective of the infrastructure and locations.

I hope by now, you are able to relate to the above views. There are several solutions that are available today and I had the opportunity to work with one such. I intend to share my some of my experiences in my upcoming posts as I experiment more. Until then, I highly encourage you to watch this [video](https://youtu.be/iuqbVfCchUI).
